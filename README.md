# Skip2List

An augmented skiplist data structure that adapts to the probability distribution of the queried data. It uses guard entries to "skip the skiplist", hence the name.

## Why did you make this?

Because I can.

## Will this help anyone?

Maybe, maybe not. I don't really know. It sounds nice in principle though.
